# recommendation-system-analysis
This project presents an integrated approach to product recommendation systems combining collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and clustering techniques. Collaborative filtering leverages user-item interactions to recommend items based on similarities between users or items, capturing patterns in user preferences. Content-based filtering recommends items to users based on the attributes or features of the items themselves, analyzing textual descriptions or metadata. K-means clustering is employed to group similar items together based on their features, enhancing recommendation diversity and relevance. The integrated system combines these techniques to provide personalized and diverse recommendations to users, leveraging both user preferences and item characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enhancing user experience and driving engagement in e-commerce and content platforms.
